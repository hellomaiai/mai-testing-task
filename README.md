# Description

The sample project contains a framework with a fighter jet following a spline through a map full of asteroids. The Pawn implementation contains a sub optimal firing logic that wastes a lot of ammunition and frequently misses. Improve the firing logic to reach higher score and fix itâ€™s performance problems. Shooting moving asteroids yields more score than shooting standing asteroids and accuracy is used as a multiplier in the total score calculation.
The game is missing one crucial piece that will be part of the assignment. The score information is displayed only as a debug text. Once the jet reaches the finish line display a proper scoreboard.
